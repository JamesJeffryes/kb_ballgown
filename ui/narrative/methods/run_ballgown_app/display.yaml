parameter-groups :
    condition_pair_subset :
        ui-name : OR List a subset of at least two conditions on which run paired combinations"

    <p>This App allows the users to select the single-end or paired-end read files and provide the metadata for a set of samples to create RNASeqSampleSet object. Note that the user must provide reads for two or more samples.</p>

    <p>Users need to import single-end or paired-end read files to the Data Pane before starting this App.</p>

    <p>It is mandatory for users to select the "Library Type", "Domain", "RNA-seq Sample and Condition Labels" and provide the "RNA-seq Sample Set" (RNASeqSampleSet object name). All replicates for the same condition must have same label.</p>

    <p>Users can optionally fill in additional metadata information in the advanced options.</p>
